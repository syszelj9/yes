# To-do list manager

## What it does
The program creates a To-Do List Manager GUI with the following elements:

- A task label and entry box for adding tasks
- An "Add" button to add tasks to the list
- A listbox to display the tasks
- An "Edit" button to modify tasks
- A "Delete" button to remove tasks
- A "Save" button to save the tasks to a file
- A "Load" button to load tasks from a file
The program stores the tasks in a file called `"tasks.txt"` in the same directory as the program. When the program is launched, it automatically loads any saved tasks from the file.
